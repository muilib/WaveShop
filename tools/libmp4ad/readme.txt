This folder contains the source for the libmp4ad DLL, which is WaveShop's wrapper around the libfaad2 AAC decoding library. The libmp4ad DLL incorporates libfaad2 (which decodes AAC) and mp4ff (which parses MP4), combining them into a single DLL that handles both AAC and AAC/MP4 files via a greatly simplified interface, derived from the top-level decoder in the aacDECdrop project. For the API, see libmp4ad.h, or the test project libmp4adtest. The libfaad2 source is unmodified except for a minor change in common.h to allow compilation for 64-bit Windows: in the rounding function lrintf, if _WIN64 is defined, intrinsics are subsituted for the inline x86 assembler.
