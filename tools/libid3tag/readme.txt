This folder contains the sources for Underbit's libid3tag library, but configured to build a DLL instead of a static library, including Visual Studio 2008 projects for both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows. The DLL exports only a small subset of the library's functions, but this is easily changed by editing libid3tag.def.

The C source files are identical to the original 0.15.1b distribution, except for a single one-line change to id3tag.h: an id3_free function was added. The id3_free function is a custom extension of id3tag, to facilitate porting it to a DLL. DLLs should free any memory they allocate, and if these allocations are exposed to the user, the DLL should provide a method for freeing them, so that freeing is done by the DLL's heap manager, which may differ from the application's.

Some id3tag functions allocate an object on the heap and rely on the caller to free the object; examples include id3_ucs4_latin1duplicate and similar functions. In a DLL version of id3tag, such objects MUST be freed using id3_free instead of free, otherwise the heap may be corrupted, potentially crashing the application.
